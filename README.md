It is a clone of Netflix's web interface. This app was created using React functional components, Redux state management, axios async/await requests, and deployed on Google Firebase. Firebase Authentication allows user account creation. Additional functionality includes customer subscription checkout powered by Stripe API integration. Once a user is subscribed, movie data is pulled from The Movie Database (TMDB) for trending movies and movie poster images. Movie trailers are integrated from YouTube if one is successfully found.
